This is a react native project that was ejected from the react native quickstart.

Only the android version is setup. To run android in dev mode, update the path in `android/local.properties` to the android SDK. Make sure you have the java SDK installed. If you are using windows, you might have to set a `JAVA_HOME` system variable to the path of the java SDK. Then use `npm run android`.
